- __Abstract__
  
> In this work, we introduce an application of topological data analysis, which is a new framework of data analysis and a combination of topology and computation. Topological data analysis employs the persistence concept with the homology theory in algebraic topology so that it can be more efficient to detect hidden topological features of the data than the other existing data analysis methods. This method is often useful to the data analysis process with conventional data analysis methods such as hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, multidimensional scaling. We used these conventional methods to analyze the internal relationship of variables. We also developed the GUI (Graphical User Interface) program to implement our process in this paper. We analyzed joint kinematics in biomechanics for 9 subjects with 31 variables as an application case. Our finding is that the joint angles of right body parts cause the difference between subjects, and also we found that subject 4 and subject 7, and subject 8 and 9 have a similar topological structure for each other.
